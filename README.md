# Repository overview

The repository is divided into two folders:
* arduino
* rpi

Which contain the code which is run on the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi respectively. Additionally, there are some non code files: 
* Plan.md containing a plan on

## Arduino folder:
  
  The arduino folder consists of one file: sketch_servo_listen_motor. The code on this file handles  2 things. For one it is resposible for the blind positioning code and secondly it handles the communication between the raspberry pi and the drive/servo motors. 

## Rpi folder 
*Coordinates

the coordinates folder on the rpi contains important information on the coordinate grid and has a number of hardcoded coordinates and functions for functionality. It is subdivided into Coordinate files for the Borders of the playing field, lines we can encounter on the playing field and possible locations of traffic lights.
